# PAYMENT STATUS FIX - COMPLETE SOLUTION ✅

## 🎯 ISSUE RESOLVED

**Problem**: Orders showing "SHIPPED" status but payment status still "PENDING" instead of "SUCCESS"

**Root Cause**: Auto-update logic only triggered when order status changed to "processing", but orders progressing through multiple statuses (processing → confirmed → shipped → delivered) didn't update payment status properly.

## ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Enhanced Auto-Update Logic**

**Before Fix:**
- Payment status only updated to "success" when order status = "processing"
- Orders moved to "shipped" or "delivered" directly kept "pending" payment

**After Fix:**
- Payment status updates to "success" for ANY confirmed status: 
  - ✅ "processing"
  - ✅ "confirmed" 
  - ✅ "shipped"
  - ✅ "delivered"

### 2. **Added "Fix Payment" Button**

**For Existing Orders with Wrong Payment Status:**
- **Location**: Admin Order Management table + Order details modal
- **Appearance**: Yellow button labeled "Fix Payment" or "Fix Payment Status"
- **Trigger**: Automatically shows for orders with confirmed status but "pending" payment
- **Action**: Instantly updates payment status from "pending" to "success"
